KUBERANETES:

Also known as K8s, it is an open source system for:
1. Automating Deployment
2. Management of Containerized apps
3. Scaling

-> It support different infrastructure.
-> It is developed by GOOGLE and now it is maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).


What is container orchestration?
-> K8 is like a master who manages slaves(containers) how to perform.

What is pod?
-> A single instance of a running process in a cluster.
-> It can run one or more containers and share the same resources.

Components of Master Node:

API SERVER
Schedular              assign node to newly created Pods
ETCD                   key-value store, having all cluster data
Control Manager        responsible for managing the state of the cluster


Component of Worker Node:

kubelet                 Agent, make sure containers running in pods

                        POD, Container run in a pod
kube-proxy              Maintains network rules for comm with pods
container-runtime      A tool responsible for running containers

Features of Kubernetes:

1. Container Orchestration
2. Scalability
3. Load Balancing
4. Rollouts and Rollback
5. High Availability

Example there is a container and I need to initialize pod for that.
Basically it take docker image form docker hub and run in a pod.

Sample yamlConfig file,,,

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: my-pod
spec:
   containers:
     - name: my-container
       image: nginx
       ports:
     - containerPort: 80
